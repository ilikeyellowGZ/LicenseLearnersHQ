          <p>
            The process of applying for a learner's licence may vary
            depending on your location. Generally, you will need to meet
            certain age requirements, provide necessary documents, pass a
            written knowledge test, and pay the required fees. Check with
            your local motor vehicle department or licensing authority for
            specific application guidelines.

          <h2>Do I need a learner's licence to start driving lessons?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, in most jurisdictions, a learner's licence is required
            before you can begin driving lessons. It allows you to practice
            driving under the supervision of a licensed driver who meets the
            requirements set by your local licensing authority.

          <p>
            The time it takes to obtain a learner's licence can vary
            depending on various factors, such as the processing time of
            your local licensing authority and your readiness for the exam.
            It's important to allow sufficient time for studying and
            preparation before scheduling your exam.
